struct Pipeline {
  each stage: each stage type
}

stage type = empty | stage data | stall | fault | hazard etc

stall, fault and hazard can be complex types as well

each stage has a matcher function Future that attempts to produce the next stage type

the overall chip has a matcher that feeds the first pipeline stage, spawns off tasks to run each pipeline in, and holds the chip state that pipeline stages may need to access.

So, something like

macro_rules! chip_stuff {
  (
    enum $state_container:ident;
    fn $step_fn:ident;
    $(@stage $in:ident $fn:ident $out:ident);+
    @cell $cell:ty; // Cell type
    @addr $addr:ty; // Address type
    @chip_extra_state $chip_extra_name:ident: $chip_extra:ty; // Chip extra state eg stalled, error
    @memory $memory:ty; // Memory type
    @genraw $unextract:ident $from:ty;
    @initial_fetch $fetch:expr; // Get a cell value to feed to the first stage of the pipeline from memory
    @instructions
    $($ins:ident = $encoding:expr, $($id:ident|$size:ty|$processed_type:ty),* $proc:block);+;
  )
}
